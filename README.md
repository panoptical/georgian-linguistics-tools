georgian-linguistics-tools
==========================

Right now the only tool this repo contains is a C++ library that enables working with Georgian text.  It contains functions to read and write UTF-8 encoded Georgian characters, represent Georgian text internally in a way that allows one to use C++ string functionality (comparisons, character counts, etc), and convert Georgian text to and from a single-character Latin transcription that allows one to work with console input/output methods.

The purpose of this library was ultimately to compile a corpus/dictionary of Georgian which could be used for other linguistic tasks, such as parsing, stemming, translation, language teaching, etc.  That project is "ongoing" in the sense that I have theoretically not given up despite not having had any time for it in just over a year.
